# CozyReads
Build healthy reading habits by tracking reading progress and planning future
reads.

## Description
CozyReads is a reading habit tracker with a personal touch. Set goals, track
your progress, and visualize your taste in books without the pressure of a
social media community and comparison culture. Customize tags and filter graphs
however you wish. Plan out your "To Read" list so that you are always looking
forward to your next book.

CozyReads is available to download on iOS and iPadOS from the App Store.

## Features

- Set and track your progress towards yearly reading goals.
- Plan your next read with a "To Read" list
- Rate books to remember how you felt about them years later
- Customize tags on books to keep track of whatever information is important to
_you_
- Visualize your reading habits and tastes with graphs by author, series, genre,
tags, and more!

## Development

CozyReads is developed as a hobby to track reading lists and stats. I previously
tracked my reading habits in a spreadsheet, and found myself with some free time
to work on this personal project to translate that into a mobile app.

### Open Source

I am sharing CozyReads source code openly in hopes that someone finds it
interesting. I welcome any requests or PRs for discussion.

I have implemented In-App Purchases to hopefully supplement the app's
development. Please consider contributing back in one way or another, and not
just forking and re-releasing as your own work.
